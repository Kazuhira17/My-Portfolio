    <h5 class="center">Sport: Badminton</h5>
    <p> I started playing badminton when I was in high school, My cousin let me borrowed her racket and I just started to gain interest on playing the game.</p>
    <img src="../img/gaming.jpg" alt="gaming" style="width:400px;height:220px;" class="center">
    <h5 class="center">Hobbies: Playing Games & Watching Animes</h5>
    <p> I spent my nights on either playing video games or just watching movies and  TV shows that are currently popular or just known classics. These are basically my escape from reality.</p>
    <img src="../img/animebinge.jpg" alt="animebinge" style="width:400px;height:220px;" class="center">
    <p> I'm also a huge fan of Japanese animation, each shows vary and may be over the top but they provide some aspects that a normal television couldn't offer and they are also drawn in different art styles which make them unique from one another.</p>

    <h3 class="center">Favorite Music & Movies</h3>
    <h4 class="center">Favorite Music:</h4>
    <img src="../img/music.png" alt="music" style="width:900px;height:300px;" class="center">
    <h6>From left to right: Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up (1987), a-ha's Take on Me (1985), Ben E. King's Stand By Me (1961).</h6>
    <p>I am a huge fan of music and my preferences varies from different genres. I listen to modern pop music, rock, EDMs, classics, indie music, movie soundtracks, game soundtracks and even Japanese music. It is very hard to pick a "most" favorite music but if someone ask me I always prefer to say some old but gold music as they were very good and stand the test of time.</p>

    <h4 class="center">Favorite Movies:</h4>
    <img src="../img/movies.jpg" alt="movies" style="width:900px;height:8=400px;" class="center">
    <h6>From left to right: Spider-Man 2 (2004), Edge Of Tomorrow (2014) Kingsman: The Secret Service (2015), Your Name (Kimi No Na Wa)(2016).</h6>
    <p> I'm also a huge fan of movies and if I am hype for an upcoming release, I want to watch them at cinema first hand if possible, there is a fulfilling feeling witnessing a masterpiece on the big screen. There are a lot of good movies out there and we obviously have our own preferences but my choices have a sentimental value to me and they are really good in my opinion.

    <h3 class="center">Favorite Programming Language</h3>
    <h4 class="center"></h4>
    <img src="../img/language.jpg" alt="language" style="width:600px;height:400px;" class="center">
    <h4 class="center">C++</h4>
    <p>C++ is my first ever programming language and it was very hard and very outdated by the time. The other reason for being this my favorite language of all is because most games were built using these programming language, old and new games via Unreal Engine. Most people would prefer to learn Javascript ot other programming language but I want to pursue learning this language because I know I will needing this in the future.</div>
